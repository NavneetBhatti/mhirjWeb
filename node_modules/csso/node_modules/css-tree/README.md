CSSTree is a tool set for CSS: [fast](https://github.com/postcss/benchmark) detailed parser (CSS → AST), walker (AST traversal), generator (AST → CSS) and lexer (validation and matching) based on specs and browser implementations. The main goal is to be efficient and W3C specs compliant, with focus on CSS analyzing and source-to-source transforming tasks.

> NOTE: The library isn't in final shape and needs further improvements (e.g. AST format and API are subjects to change in next major versions). However it's stable enough and used by projects like [CSSO](https://github.com/css/csso) (CSS minifier) and [SVGO](https://github.com/svg/svgo) (SVG optimizer) in production.
